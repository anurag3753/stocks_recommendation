S&R:
- For a long trade, the low of the pattern should be around the support
- For a short trade, the high of the pattern should be around the resistance

MA:
MA works brilliantly when their is a trend and fails to perform when the stock moves sideways. This basically means the `MA` in its simplest form is a trend following system.
- `Buy`  when the short term ma(25days) turns greater than long term ma(50days). Stay in trade as long as condition is satisfied.
- `Exit` the long position when the short term ma(25days) turns lesser than long term ma(50days).

RSI:
RSI is a leading momentum indicator which helps in identifying a trend reversal. RSI indicator oscillates between 0 and 100.
RSI is the most popular leading indicator, which gives out strongest signals during the periods of sideways and non trending ranges.
Objective of using RSI is to help the trader identify over sold and overbought price areas.
Overbought implies that the positive momentum in the stock is so high that it may not be sustainable for long and hence there could be a correction.
Likewise, an oversold position indicates that the negative momentum is high leading to a possible reversal.

Tips:
- Suppose RSI value of 26.8 also coincides with bullish engulfing pattern. It is a double confirmation to go long. Needless to say that both volume and S&R also confirm to this.
- If the RSI is fixed in an overbought region for a prolonged period, look for buying opportunities instead of shorting. The RSI stays in the overbought region for a prolonged period because of an excess positive momentum.
- If the RSI is fixed in an oversold region for a prolonged period, look for selling opportunities rather than buying. RSI stays in the oversold region for a prolonged period because of an excess negative momentum.
- If the RSI value starts moving away from the oversold value after a prolonged period, look for buying opportunities. For example, the RSI moves above 30 after a long time may mean that the stock may have bottomed out, hence a case of going long.
- If the RSI value starts moving away from the overbought value after a prolonged period, look for selling opportunities. For example, RSI moving below 70 after a long time. This means the stock may have topped out, hence a case for shorting

Finally, do remember RSI is not used often as a standalone indicator by  traders, it is used along with other candlestick patterns and indicators to study the market.
